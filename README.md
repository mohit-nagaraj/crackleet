## Overview
CrackLeet is an Electron-based overlay application designed to assist with coding interview problems like those found on LeetCode. It captures screenshots of problems, sends them to Gemini AI for analysis, and displays generated code solutions and explanations directly on your screen.

## Features
- **Completely hidden**: View solutions in a transparent overlay that stays on top of your browser + uses dmv cloaking ;) impossible to detect
- **No cmd terminals** - Taskbar remains clean
- **Problem Analysis**: Capture screenshots of coding problems from platforms like LeetCode
- **AI-Powered Solutions**: Leverages Google's Gemini AI to analyze problems and generate solutions
- **Code Explanation**: Get detailed explanations for each solution
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Clear code formatting with syntax highlighting
